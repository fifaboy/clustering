# Clustering
This is a paper on k-means clustering. It talks about the results in k-means++ paper and discusses various seeding methods of center initializations.

# Checking results
This is a python based project. So, install python 3. You will need ```jupyter``` and ```scikit-learn``` packages in order to run this experiment. Install them using these commands

  ```
  pip install -U jupyter
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  ```

Change directory into the root project directory. Then use ```jupyter notebook``` to open jupyter in your browser. There are two notebooks you can run for verifying the results. One is ```kmeans++_check``` and the other is ```compare```. They will create output CSV files that contain the results in subdirectory ```out```.
