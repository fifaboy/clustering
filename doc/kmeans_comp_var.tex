			$k$-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that reduces sum of minimum distances from data points to the centers. Now a days most of the times seeded centers are used instead of choosing all uniformly at random. $k$-Means++ chooses the centers with a so called $D^2$ weighting. However, that is only one of the ways. Similar ideas are possible for seeding the centers. In this paper, we improve $k$-Means++ by choosing the first center with a probability instead of selecting a random point and a new way of initializing the centers. Empirical evidence shows that our proposed algorithms perform better than available methods of center initialization consistently. We will explore some easily derivable properties of a set of points that explains why this kind of initialization works so well.

	\section{Introduction}
	Widely regarded as the most popular clustering techniques, $k$-Means remains a humble interesting topic in machine learning as well as computational geometry. Roughly the problem is: given a set of points $\X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Find a set of centers $\mathcal{C}$ such that the function \textit{inertia}
		\begin{align*}
			\mathcal{I} & = \sum_{\x\in\X}\min_{\c\in\C}(\|\c-\x\|^2)
		\end{align*}
	is minimum where $\|\cdot\|$ is the $L_2$ norm\footnote{$\|c-x\|$ or $L_2$ norm of $\c-\x$ is the distance between the center $\c$ and point $\x$ or the magnitude of the vector $\c-\x$.}.
	
	Default $k$-Means algorithm starts with random centers and then converge based on minimum distances of the centers from the data points. New centers are calculated based on the centroid. This is known as Lloyd's algorithm \citep{lloyd}. We repeat this process until no more change is possible. \cite{ostrovsky} and \cite{kmeans++} take it one step further by choosing the initial centers carefully. Only the first one or two centers are chosen uniformly at random. Then the rest of the centers are chosen with a probability. We intend to introduce other ways of initialization.
	\section{Related Work}
	There has been multiple surveys on $k$-Means in the literature. Probably the most relevant work in this regard is done by \cite{celebi}. However, most of the algorithms used in that paper are not used practically very much. It was also noted by the authors themselves that $k$-Means++ and its greedy version work better than most. They also mention that probabilistic algorithms perform better than deterministic ones. Moreover, another highly influential center initialization algorithm \citep{ostrovsky} was not considered in their experiments. There is no mention of Ostrovsky's algorithm in their paper whatsoever. Surprisingly, there is no mention of Ostrovsky's algorithm in $k$-Means++ paper either even though it was published in $2007$ whereas Ostrovsky's algorithm was published in $2006$.
	
	We would also like to point out that to our knowledge no surveys were done after removing linear dependency prior to running the experiments. This is a very important step if we are to get a meaningful clustering out of $k$-Means algorithm. PCA also helps with some drawbacks of $k$-Means such as $k$-Means struggles with non-spherical data set. PCA decomposes the existing data points into orthogonal\footnote{It is well known that orthogonal vectors are linearly independent.} ones. If we use PCA (principal component analysis) before running a clustering algorithm, we can redefine the variables into linearly independent ones. For our experiment, we have used PCA on every data set before running cluster algorithm.
	\section{Proposed Initialization Methods}
	For a set of points $S$ and a point $x$, we use $\min(\|x-S\|)$ to denote the minimum of distances from $x$ to the points of $S$ that is $\min(\| x-S\|)=\min_{a\in S}(\| x-a\|)$. Set $D(\x)=\min(\|\x-\C\|)$ for a point $x$ and a set of centers $\C$. Let us denote the centroid of $S$ by $\mu_S$ that is $\mu_S=\dfrac{1}{|S|}\sum_{x\in S}x$.
	\subsection{First center for $k$-Means++}
	In $k$-Means++ algorithm, the first center is chosen uniformly at random. However, not all points have the same contribution to inertia. We choose $x$ as a first center in a way that is analogous to explained variance ratio by $x$.
	\begin{enumerate}[i]
		\item Choose $\x$ with probability $\dfrac{f(\x)}{\sum_{\y\in\X}f(\y)}$ where $f(x)=\sum_{\y\in\X}\|\x-\y\|^2$. Set $\C_1=\{\x\}$.\label{step:first_center}
		\item Repeat the remaining steps in $k$-Means++ \cite[Section $2.2$, Page $3$]{kmeans++}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Centroid of Centers Based Seeding}
	In this method, we want to choose $x$ with probability proportional to squared distance from centroid of the cluster centers. As we will show later, this is inspired from the idea of choosing $x$ with probability proportional to $\sum_{c\in\C}\|x-c\|^2$.
		\begin{enumerate}[i]
			\item Choose a centers $\x$ like the first center for $k$-Means++ as stated in\eqref{step:coc_center}. Set $\C_1=\{\x\}$.
			\item For an already existing set of $i$ centers $\mathcal{C}_i=\{c_1,\cdots,c_i\}$, choose a new center $\x\in\X$ with probability proportional to $\|\x-\mu_{\C_i}\|^2$.\label{step:coc_center}
			\item Repeat step \eqref{step:coc_center} until $i=k$.
			\item For each $1\leq i\leq k$, set $\C_i=\{\x\in\X:\|\x-c_i\|=\min(x-\C)\}$.\label{step:coc_cluster}
			\item Set $c_i=\mu_{\C_i}$.\label{step:coc_update}
			\item Repeat \eqref{step:coc_cluster} and \eqref{step:coc_update} until convergence or number of iteration is reached.
		\end{enumerate}
	\section{Analysis}
	First, we will analyze the choosing of first center in $k$-Means++. 
	\subsection{$k$-Means++ Improved}
	Consider a set of $n$ points $\X$ and that the probability of $x\in\X$ being chosen as a center as $p(x)$. From the definition of variance, for a set of points $S$,
		\begin{align}
			\sigma^2(S) & = \dfrac{\sum_{x\in S} \|x-\mu_{S}\|^2}{|S|}\nonumber\\
			\sum_{x\in S}\|x-\mu_{S}\|^2 & = |S|\sigma^2\label{eqn:1}
		\end{align}
	For any arbitrary point $a$ and $\mu$ as the centroid of $\X$,
		\begin{align}
			\sum_{\x\in\X}\|\x-a\|^2
				  & = \sum_{\x\in\X}\|\x-\mu+\mu-a\|^2\nonumber\\
				  & = \sum_{\x\in\X}\left(\|\x-\mu\|^2+2\langle\x-\mu,\mu-a\rangle+\|\mu-a\|^2\right)\nonumber\\
				  & = \sum_{\x\in\X}\|\x-\mu\|^2+2\left\langle\sum_{\x\in\X}\x-n\mu,\mu-a\right\rangle+n\|\mu-a\|^2\nonumber\\
				  & = n\sigma^2+2\langle n\mu-n\mu,\mu-a\rangle+n\|\mu-a\|^2\nonumber\\
				  & = n(\sigma^2+\|\mu-a\|^2)\label{eqn:2}
		\end{align}
	This is the inspiration we mentioned in centroid of centers seeding. Using equation \eqref{eqn:2}, we have the following.
		\begin{align}
			\sum_{\x\in\X}\sum_{\y\in\X}\|\x-\y\|^2 
				& = \sum_{\x\in\X}n(\sigma^2+\|\mu-\x\|^2)\nonumber\\
				& = n(n\sigma^2+\sum_{\x\in\X}\|\mu-\x\|^2)\nonumber\\
				& = n(n\sigma^2+n\sigma^2)\nonumber\\
				& = 2n^2\sigma^2\label{eqn:3}
		\end{align}
	Using equation \eqref{eqn:3}, the probability becomes
		\begin{align*}
			p(x) & = \dfrac{\sum_{\y\in\X}\|\x-\y\|^2}{\sum_{\y\in\X}\sum_{\x'\in\X}\|\x'-\y\|^2}\\
				 & = \dfrac{n(\sigma^2+\|\mu-\x\|^2)}{2n\sigma^2}\\
				 & = \dfrac{\sigma^2+\|\mu-\x\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\\
				 & = \dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{\|\mu-\x\|^2}{2\sigma^2}
		\end{align*}
	Now it becomes more clear how this is related to explained variance ratio. However, to make things smoother, one can also choose to use the following as the probability of $x$ being chosen as the first center.
		\begin{align*}
			p(x) & = \dfrac{\|\mu-\x\|^2}{2\sigma^2}
		\end{align*}
	Also, notice that computationally this version of $p(x)$ is much cheaper than the one we mentioned above. Therefore, we considered $p(x)$ proportional to $\|x-\mu\|^2$ for choosing $x$ as the first center in our experiments.
	\subsection{Centroid of Centers Seeding}
	We will now analyze the center initialization algorithms using inertia value. Since these algorithms are probabilistic, we are going to take a look at the expected value of inertia. For a set of points $\X$ and a set of centers $\C$, we denote the inertia by $\I_\C(\X)$. For the optimal set of cluster centers $\C_{opt}$, we denote the corresponding inertia by $\I_{opt}(\X)$.
		\begin{align*}
			\I_\C(\X) & = \sum_{\x\in\X}\min_{\c\in\C}(\|c-x\|^2)
		\end{align*}
	If the context is clear, we may omit $\C$ and $\X$. For a fixed set of points $\X$, if the probability of $\x\in\X$ being chosen to be a center is $p(x)$ with respect to a set of centers $\C$, then the expected value of inertia $E[\I(\X)]$ is
		\begin{align*}
			E[\I(\X)] & = \sum_{\x\in\X}p(x)\sum_{\y\in\X}\min(D(x),\|y-x\|)^2
		\end{align*}
	The following lemma was proven in \cite[Lemma $3.2$]{kmeans++}.
		\begin{lemma}
			Let $A$ be an arbitrary cluster in $\C_{opt}$, and let $\C$ be the clustering with just one center, which is chosen uniformly at random from $A$. Then, $E[\I(A)]=2\I_{opt}(A)$.
		\end{lemma}
	Here, $\I_{opt}(A)=\sum_{x\in A}\sum_{b\in A}\|a-b\|^2$. 
	
	Now, we want to find a similar formula for the remaining centers using centroid of centers seeding. If we take $p(x)$ proportional to $f(x)=\|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2$, then using equation \eqref{eqn:2},
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) & = \|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2\\
			\sum_{x\in S}f(x) 
				& = \sum_{x\in S}\|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2\\
				& = |S|(\sigma^2+\|\mu_S-\mu_{\C}\|^2)
		\end{align*}
	Then the probability of $x$ being chosen as a center is
		\begin{align*}
			p(x) & = \dfrac{f(x)}{\sum_{y\in S}f(y)}\\
				 & = \dfrac{\|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2}{|S|(\sigma^2+\|\mu_{S}-\mu_{\C}\|^2)}
		\end{align*}
	Since $D(y)\leq \|y-\mu_{\C}\|$, we have the following
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{y\in S}\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2 & \geq D(y)^2\\
			\dfrac{1}{\sum_{y\in S}\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2} & \leq \dfrac{1}{\sum_{y\in S}D(y)^2}\\
			\dfrac{\sum_{y\in S}D(y)^2}{\sum_{y\in S}\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2} & \leq 1
		\end{align*}
	Our expected value of inertia would be
		\begin{align*}
			E[\I(S)] & = \sum_{x\in S}p(x)\sum_{y\in S}\min(D(y),\|x-y\|)^2\\
					   & = \sum_{x\in S}\dfrac{\|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2}{\sum_{y\in S}\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2}\sum_{y\in S}\min(D(y),\|x-y\|)^2\\
					   %& \leq \sum_{y\in S}\dfrac{1}{n}\dfrac{\sum_{y\in S}2(\|x-y\|^2)+2(\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2)}{\sum_{y\in S}\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2}\sum_{y\in S}\min(D(y),\|x-y\|)^2\\
					   & \leq \sum_{x\in S}\dfrac{\|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2}{\sum_{y\in S}\|y-\mu_{\C}\|^2}\sum_{y\in S}D(y)^2\\
					   & \leq \sum_{x\in S}\|x-\mu_{\C}\|^2
		\end{align*}
	Using equation \eqref{eqn:2}, we have
		\begin{align*}
			E[\I(S)] & \leq n(\sigma^2+\|\mu_S-\mu_{\C}\|^2)
		\end{align*}
	Now, using equation \eqref{eqn:3}, we have
		\begin{align*}
			\I_{opt}(S) & = \sum_{x\in S}\sum_{y\in S}\|x-y\|^2\\
						  & = 2n^2\sigma^2\\
			\dfrac{\I_{opt}(S)}{2n} & = n\sigma^2
		\end{align*}
	Thus, we have the following theorem.
		\begin{theorem}
			Let $S$ be an arbitrary cluster chosen from $\C_{opt}$ and $\C$ be an arbitrary clustering. If a center is chosen from $S$ and added to $\C$ using centroid of centers initialization, then
				\begin{align*}
					E[\I(S)] & \leq \dfrac{\I_{opt}(S)}{2n}+n\|\mu_{S}-\mu_{\C}\|^2
				\end{align*}
		\end{theorem}		
	\section{Experiment Setup}
	We ensure that all algorithms are run under the same conditions. All of them share the same environment and no special optimizations were made for any particular algorithm. Only CPU was used to determine the values we are interested in and no parallelism mechanism was in place for speeding up the process. This way, we can get an idea about the raw performances of the algorithms involved.
	
	Python is used as the programming language to write necessary codes. Some common auxiliary packages such as \textit{scipy, scikit-learn, numpy} etc are used to help with the code. The algorithms are simply different methods of the same class, so they share the same fitting and prediction function. Only the initialization differs for different algorithm. It should be mentioned that even though some packages have native support for $k$-Means implementation, we did not use them to run the experiments. Not all algorithms we want to test are available in those packages. Therefore, in order to ensure same environment and optimizations for every algorithm, we wrote them all from scratch so that we could be sure they are tested under the same settings.
	
	The data sets we have used are some popular ones: Iris data set, Mall customers data set, Airline clustering data set, Wine testing dataset. We did not duel too much on using too many data sets. \cite{miligan} shows that using $z$-score to standardize the data is not favorable for clustering because it loses between-cluster variation. Therefore, we did not use any sort of standardization or normalization lest it should lose variance. Instead, we have used PCA to remove linear dependency among variables. 
	
	While experimenting on such algorithms, it is of utmost importance to run the same experiment more than once under the same parameters and conditions. For example, assume that we want to compare $k$-Means++ and Forgy's algorithm \citep{forgy} for $k=5$ clusters. We should run this experiment at least $m$ times where $m>1$ in order to eliminate bias and account for randomness. We run each experiment a total of $20$ times and take the average and minimum values of inertia.
	
	We would like to address another important issue regarding $k$-Means algorithms. Most of the time we 
	\section{Results}
	We present the results on those four algorithms based on inertia and time required to run them. Instead of checking how many iterations it take for the centers to converge, we have let each algorithm run exactly the same number of times ($300$) which is more than enough for convergence. The time registered here is the time taken by each algorithm for those $300$ iterations. As expected, default $k$-Means is the fastest algorithm. However, if we were to define convergence, that leads to a separate problem which we think other implementations suffer from. We also mentioned something similar before. This might also be one of the reasons why our results of $k$-Means++ differ from the authors implementation. Our argument is also complemented by the experiments. All algorithms seem to reach the same minimum inertia. Therefore, it is the average of inertia that we should focus on.

				\end{tabular}
				\caption{Results on Mall customer dataset, $5$ clusters}
				\label{tbl:mall2}
			\end{center}
		\end{table}
	Notice that in all cases, we achieved lower minimum inertia for $k$-Means++ and yet $k$-Means++ improved version achieved lower inertia on average. Moreover, even though these are randomized algorithms, pretty much every time we ran the experiments, $k$-Means++ improved version performed better. Given the mathematical intuitive justification and experimental results, we are inclined to say that this version works better than original $k$-Means++ consistently.
